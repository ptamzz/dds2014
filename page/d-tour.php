				In an attempt to give students a hands-on experience of the design process, through which students 
				can solve real world problems by using technical skills, students of IDC would be conducting workshops 
				across various campuses in Mumbai.

				Calligraphy is an ancient art with historical and cultural significance in may parts of the world. Simply defined, 
				calligraphy  means “beautiful writing”. The ability to create perfectly balanced and artful lettering is still a 
				valuable skill. In the digital age, people want calligraphy because it imparts a personal touch and adds depth and 
				character to a text.
			</p>
			<p>
				Whether you are already into calligraphy or you would like to learn about it, you’ll find a lot of fun and enjoyment 
				in it.

				The workshop's objective is to use the design process to come up with innovation ideas using a hardware prototyping platform. 
				It's intended for engineers and DIY hobbyists who want to create interactive objects or environments.
			</p>
			<p>
				The workshop would start with a brief discussion about the trends in contemporary technology and try to predict future trends.
				This will be followed by an introduction to micro-controllers, with an overview of Open Hardware and community driven projects.
			</p>
			<p>
				We shall be using Arduino platform to make prototypes.
