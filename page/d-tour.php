				Calligraphy is an ancient art with historical and cultural significance in may parts of the world. Simply defined, 
				calligraphy  means “beautiful writing”. The ability to create perfectly balanced and artful lettering is still a 
				valuable skill. In the digital age, people want calligraphy because it imparts a personal touch and adds depth and 
				character to a text.

				Whether you are already into calligraphy or you would like to learn about it, you’ll find a lot of fun and enjoyment 
				in it.
