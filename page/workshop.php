			<p>A product is not just forms and functions. It involves the user directly and hence transcends the physical space and 
				enters the realm of emotional responses, cultural sensitivity and intuitiveness.</p>
			<p class="quote">How will the world look if it is not designed?</p>
			<p>This, and a lot more questions will be answered by sensitising you about the problems around us. Understanding forms, 
				functions and usability of products through process, examples and case studies, you will get a chance to unleash your
				creative, analytical mind to come up with better design solutions.</p>

			<p>The workshop is aimed to provide various important aspects that go into designing characters through the process 
				of "Ideation", "Character Design", "Character Story" and "Final Design" will be followed.</p>
			<p class="quote">What does it take to create a memorable character?</p>
			<p>Character design is the visual representation of a character concept or idea. They are used for gaming, illustrations, movies, comics, graphic novels and vast array of things. It is a collaboration of design and visual communication. The Design aspect looks upon the fucntionality of design, whereas visual communication provides aesthetic value to it.</p>

			<p>The workshop's objective is to use design process to come up with innovation ideas using hardware prototyping platform. 
				It's intented for engineers and DIY hobbyists who want to create interactive objects or environments. The workshop would
				start with a brief discussion about the trends in contemporary technology and try to predict future trends.
				This will be followed by an introduction to micro-controllers, with an overview of Open Hardware and community driven projects.
				We shall be using Arduino platform to make prototypes.</p>

		<h3 class="title">Design Thinking Workshop</h3>
		<img src="img/design-thinking-workshop.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
		<div class="box-text">
			<p>Conventionally education in India focuses primarily on theory, analysis & subject specific skills which are examples 
				of Convergent Thinking. Students often miss out on the purpose of their learning and are confused as to where it is 
				applicable.</p>
			<p class="quote">Learning is more effective when it is an active rather than a passive process.</p>
			<p>In an attempt to give students a hands-on experience of the design process, through which students can solve real world 
				problems by using technical skills, students of IDC would be conducting workshops across various campuses in Mumbai. 
				The objective of these workshops is to enlighten the participants about design practices. This will help them understand 
				the role of design better. The workshops aim to be an enjoyable and enriching experience while developing a mind-set 
				suitable for better design.</p>

			<div class="workshop-meta-one"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span> 10:00AM to 5:30PM</div>
			<p>The objective of the workshop is to make students go out in the real world, find contextual problems from their 
				surroundings and come up with working prototypes of mobile app solutions. The innovations and advancements in 
				mobile technologies have impacted business processes in every industry. Mobility adoption has become imperative 
				for enterprises to access real-time information, to make timely and better decisions. IT companies, research labs, 
				Banking and Finance firms, product developers and service industries have already experienced the benefit of well 
				designed mobile app products for their firms.</p>
			<p>The students will learn to use prototyping tools like balsamiq for wire framing and MIT app inventor for making 
				android apps. They will be able to make working prototypes of their ideas at the end of the workshop.</p>
